# <a name='installation-guide'>Installation Guide</a>

This project requires the following tools:

- Python - The programming language used by Flask.
- PostgreSQL - A relational database system.
- Virtualenv - A tool for creating isolated Python environments.

To get started, install Python and Postgres on your local computer if you don't have them already. A simple way for Mac OS X users to install Postgres is using [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/). You can optionally use another database system instead of Postgres, like [SQLite](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/sqlite3/).

## Getting Started

**Step 1. Clone the code into a fresh folder**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YasserYka/Nawafea.git

$ cd Nawafea

```

**Step 2. Create a Virtual Environment and install Dependencies.**

Create a new Virtual Environment for the project and activate it. If you don't have the `virtualenv` command yet, you can find installation [instructions here](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Learn more about [Virtual Environments](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/#virtual-environments).

```
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Next, we need to install the project dependencies, which are listed in `requirements.txt`.

```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3: Create an app on GitHub**

Head over to [GitHub OAuth apps](https://github.com/settings/developers) and create a new OAuth app. Name it what you like but you'll need to specify a callback URL, which should be something like:

```
http://localhost:5000/auth/callback/github
```

The default port for Flask apps is `5000`, but you may need to update this if your setup uses a different port or if you're hosting your app somewhere besides your local machine.

Now we're ready to start our server which is as simple as:

```
(venv) $ flask run
```

Open http://localhost:5000 to view it in your browser.

The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and warnings in the console.
